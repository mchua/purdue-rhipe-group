In case you are interested in learning LaTeX, I think that the best
way to do it is with the wikibooks.

You can start here:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics

For this project, Professor Cleveland created a script so that you do
not have to complicate with learning LaTeX. The main idea is that you
just have to add text to each one of the .tex files (except main.tex)
that are in the documentation directory, and after you finish you can
use the script, just type:

layout

This will create the file main.pdf with all the documentation.
